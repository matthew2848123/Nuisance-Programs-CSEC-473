# Nuisance-Programs-CSEC-473

Fully runable programs are found in the dist folder (Only tested on Windows Machines, but most should work on linux as well)
To run the exe's just double click and run and you should be good, it should not require admin access unless you have some weird configuration
To run the ps1 script right click and select run, as of note this will change the language on your computer to reset this use the following powershell command 'Set-WinUserLanguageList en-US'
